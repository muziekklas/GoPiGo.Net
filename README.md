# GoPiGo.Net
The GoPiGo library from Dexter industries. I am trying to make this library work!
Initial the GoPiGo library for C# doesn't work correctly (Due to unknown reasons).

It is now a small Challange to make this work, so the robot can race a parcour :)!

Also take a look at the mono implementation, to run it on the Linux Distro's at: https://github.com/muziekklas/GoPiGo.mono
That one does work like a charm :)

I kept the same methods over there as the original library provided by Dexter industries
